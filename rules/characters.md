## Races

The most obvious part of a character is her race. Races give special abilities to characters and affect their starting skills and progression.

## Skills

Skills are designed in such a way to provide an equally valid path for a party of characters to go on adventures together, where each party member will have a few talents that makes them crucial to the team.
