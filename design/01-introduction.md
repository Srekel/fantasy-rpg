# Srekel's Fantasy RPG

## Goals

:x: means "less or none of this"

:heavy_check_mark: means "more of/like this"

### Core

#### It should be suitable to play with someone who hasn't played an RPG before.

- There should not be a lot of lore you should preferably know before starting.

#### It should be quick and easy to build a backstory for your character, a cohesive party, and relationships between the player characters.

> :x: "We're just a bunch of random people who happen to work together for no real reason."

> :x: "We will just pick the first quest that comes along and we don't *really* care about why we do it."

> :x: "We'll decide later what our group is about, let's just get started with some adventures!"

> :heavy_check_mark: "We have a common goal that makes sense for our characters and we work together to complete it."

> :heavy_check_mark: "The stories we experience are cohesive with the type of party and characters we are."

#### It should induce as little ludo-narrative dissonance as possible.

> :x: "We opened a door and inside there were 10 enemies that we really ought to have heard."

> :x: "I want to use my acrobatics skill to climb a tower but the rules only give bonuses to combat."

> :x: "I wanted to snipe the guard out but my crossbow's max damage is less than her health, so she'll alert her friends."

> :heavy_check_mark: "I tried to backstab a guard but failed, and instead of facing me for a fight to the death, she tried to flee to alert her friends."

> :heavy_check_mark: "I wanted to do something that was in line with my character and the world and I felt the rules supported that well."

#### The player should not expect to be evenly or "fairly" matched in encounters.

Potential enemies should exist in a way that makes sense within the world. If that means it's too much of a challenge for the players, they need to improve their chances, find a way around it, or abort the mission. There should generally be ample opportunities, both skill-wise and world-wise, to create an advantage.

> :x: "It's so well balanced, every combat feels so tense and we always win by a hair."

> :x: "Every encounter seems to match us evenly... isn't that strange?"

> :heavy_check_mark: "Ten goblins were guarding the entrance. We had to lure half of them away and pick them off before we could even think about attempting to take the rest out."

> :heavy_check_mark: "There was just a single guard so we took her out quickly and went on with the adventure."

#### Loot is world-based, not opposition-based.

> :x: "We killed the evil wizard and found some sick loot in her chest!"

> :heavy_check_mark: "We snuck into the evil wizard's tower and in the treasury room we found chests upon chests of gold. We took all we could carry - which caused us to fail all the sneak tests when we were getting out!"

> :heavy_check_mark: "We found and killed the goblins that had been raiding the trading caravans, and as you can imagine, there were a lot of goodies in their cave..."

#### The players are encouraged to plan ahead and to do up-front work.

> :x: "We needed to get in but there was a guard in the doorway, so I just walked over to her and tried to convince her to let us through."

> :heavy_check_mark: "We really need to get through that door without awaking suspicion. Let's buy him a beer in the local inn tonight and figure out what his weaknesses are."

#### The game should be designed so that non-violence is fun.

> :x: "The game rules are 90% about combat. Non-combat skills often tie in to combat somehow anyway, and if not, they are trivially described and just require a single die roll to check for success."

> :heavy_check_mark: "I played a smooth-talking herbalist and I never used my dagger even once in combat, but doing my things were still challenging and interesting!"

#### Rules for abilities/skills should be one or two lines long.

Descriptions can be longer, in case the players want to immerse themselves, or to see if the skill can be used in a way that the rules don't mention.

#### Failure should be uncommon but dangerous.

> :x: "I failed my Speech die roll when trying to convincing the guard to let us in so we went away and found another way in."

> :heavy_check_mark: "We didn't have time to prepare so my character didn't know how to convince the guard. She thought it was very suspicious and they doubled the guards - and needless to say, they now knew what I looked like!"

### Combat

- Should be seriously dangerous, for both enemies and player characters.
- Should frequently be over almost instantly - no drawn out DPS battles.
- Should not necessarily be *to the death* - it should be possible, even frequent and acceptable, for the loser to give up.
- Should not necessarily be the primary solution to quests.

Random encounters and ambushes should not be added just to add suspense. When they happen, the players should have more options than to fight to the death.

The players should often go into battle essentially knowing that they will win - instead feeling that the risk is rather than that they don't win it *well enough*.

- For example, it might be dangerous if even just one out of ten goblins manage to run away and and raise the alarm or tell their leader.
- Or, the players might accidentally kill the one person who had the information they wanted during a heated battle.

The players should be able to try to knock out an enemy, or coerce them to surrender. This is important both because players or characters may have aversions to killing, and because it allows for interrogations, hostage situations, and more.

The players should have many different simple options available to them - favoring quick combinatorics to create interesting combat rather than.
